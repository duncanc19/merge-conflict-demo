# merge-conflict-demo

Matt is the one and only, oh yeah
Call me, call me by my name or call me by number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest
Nobody I'd rather be
Matt is the one and only
You can't take that away from him
I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and perspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk without dignity and pride
Matt is the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
Matt is the one and only
You can't take that away from him
I can't wear this uniform without some compromises
But I can wear a bib (unlike Mario)
Because you'll find out that we come

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from us
